  # Note Taker Express

  ## Description

  This application allows a user to create and delete new notes for personal use. The front end design was given as starter code and I (with the help of a tutor) designed the back end routes with express. Coding the routes/pathing definitely did/does not come very easily to me, so this was a great exercise to get a little more comfortable.

  ## Usage

  To use please run 'npm i' in the integrated terminal before running the application in order to install the necessary dependencies. Then run the file and connect to the localhost port. Each note should have a title as well as text that can be saved by clicking the floppy disk in the top right corner. To delete a note you can simply touch the trashcan on the cards on the left side of the webpage.

  ## Credits

  Probably about 60% of the code was written with the assistance of my tutor Meg Meyers. She also looked over the code that I had written before meeting with her to make sure it looked good. In addition I also referenced various StackOverflow posts in order to better understand the pre-written starter code. The helper functions in the 'helpers' folder were mostly copied and pasted from the class activities repo. We wrote the readAndDelete function but everything else was ctrl C / ctrl P.
